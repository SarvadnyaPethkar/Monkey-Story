Once there was a monkey and a crocodile. They both were best friends.
One day crocodile's wife told him bring some flesh of a animal for their dinner.
Crocodile was not getting any animal for their dinner. So he went to monkey and told him
to give his flesh.But monkey told that he has no heart so how will I give you flesh.
He fooled the crocodile.The crocodile then went home and told his wife that
he not got any animal's flesh. And then the crocodile was beaten by his wife.
